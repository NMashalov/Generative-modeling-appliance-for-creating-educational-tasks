We propose a language model build on intersection of deep learning and pedagogy. It aims to build coherent and safisticated physiscs and math tasks for .

Result of language modeling were estimated through domain heuristics developed on metholodgy on great russian school of math. It includes:
- ranging task difficulty through mindful steps for acheving 
-  

All combined we achieved high-fidelity generation of physics and math tasks with rich framework for approaching more advanced pedagogical tasks.
